         <h3>As-Salaamu– Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh,
            It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you and provide you with information about Al Hasanain. We aim to nurture and empower pupils to become responsible Muslim citizens who will contribute to their development as well as the well-being of their family, friends, neighbours, and the community they live in.
            Not long ago,  parents had to choose between giving their children either a purely
            secular education in traditional Schools (at the expense of Islamic teaching and upbringing) or providing them with Islamic education (at the expense of academic excellence).
            Thankfully, the educational landscape has now changed drastically with the introduction of education institutions blending General curriculum with the curriculum of Madrasah in a manner such that it is made sure that both the curriculums are given equal importance and go hand in hand. 
            Al Hasanain was founded in 2018, as a purely English based Islamic institute to provide Primary Education streamlining Madani Nesab and Cambridge Curriculum for boys between 04-07 years of age in a beautiful and comfortable environment. As the institute grew in size and stature, it was time to introduce two individual campuses for boys and girls. The Boys’ campus was relocated to Road no.3 of Cosmopolitan R/A in 2022 and the old campus at Road no.3 of Cosmopolitan R/A was renovated and changed to Girls’ campus.</h3>

         <h1><br>Mission Statement</br></h1>
<h3>Our mission is to provide top quality value-based balanced education in an Islamic environment that increases 
Iman, enhances quality of A’mal, nourishes good discipline, behavior, tolerance, and respect. Our aim is to 
develop potentials in Islamic studies and research. We want each student to feel appreciated, happy and to be 
able to enjoy their learning through a stimulating environment that celebrates their individuality. We pray to 
Allah, that our institute becomes the steppingstone that will provide your children with an Islamic lifestyle 
to allow them to succeed in this world and ultimately the life, in the hereafter, In Shaa Allah!</h3>
<h3><br>Vision and Ethos</br>
   We at Al Hasanain believe that education is not just for institute but to live and achieve Allah's blessings throughout our life. Therefore, the education process must be holistic and balanced by holding firmly to the principles of the Qur'an and Sunnah. 
   "Learning is not just for institute but for life and for seeking Alimighty’s Pleasure"
    Al Hasanain aims to provide a well-rounded education to the highest of standards,
   implanting Taleem-Tarwiyah, self-esteem, and confidence. Thus enabling pupils to hold the highest of values and a positive attitude while upholding their Islamic values. In turn, making them responsible and inspiring young men and women. We believe that all children
   are unique; we develop their talents using innovative approaches using academic freedoms to meet the diverse needs of our learning community, set within an extended institute day.
